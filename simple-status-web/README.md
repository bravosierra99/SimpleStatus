# Simple Status Server

You should only be here if you are specifically interested in contributing to the Simple Status Server.  Otherwise you should simple download the docker container from [SimpleStatusServer](https://hub.docker.com/r/bravosierra99/simple-status-server)

or using `docker pull bravosierra99/simple-status-server`

## Building Locally

- cd /simple-status-web 
- npm install
- npm run build
- cd /simple-status
- py -m venv .venv
- .venv/scripts/activate -- _adjust per your terminal_
- python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
- create and edit a .env file
  - PORT=80
  - LOGGING_PATH
  - STATIC_PATH -- _should be the path to the build folder from the `npm run build` command from earlier
- python SimpleStatusServer.py || uvicorn main:app --reload -- _either will work, and should functionally be the same_

OR
- `docker build -t bravosierra99/simple-status-server -f SimpleStatusServer.dockerfile`
- `docker run -dp 80:80 bravosierra99/simple-status-server`

_in this case you would need to rebuild the image any time you make changes... so it's more of a pain but it will match the final result_

## Gotchas
- when in doubt, ctrl-f5 to reload your app, to flush out cashed files
- if you make changes to the front end, you must rerun `npm run build`

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
