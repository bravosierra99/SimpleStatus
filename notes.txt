a status consists of a component, it's status, and a date.  
components are hierarchical and therefore a component can have a parent and a component can have children.
new status's over-rule old status
if a component has children, it is the "worst" status of it's children.  Unless it is explicitely given a status

components have a configuration, the configuration dictates children and parents
the configuration dictates timeouts
the configuration dictates colors associated with 

configuration is sent programatically from the components
a key identifies a component
a key identifies a parent of a component
a parent doesn't necessarily know it's children



status = {
	component-key: <string>
	status: <enumeration>
	dtg: <dtg>
}

configuration = {
	component-key: <string>
	parent-component-key: <string>
	component-name: <string>
	statuses: [<string>:color]
	timeout: <time_delta>
}

the backend will build the top down linkages when components are added (via adding a configuration)
this will be used to determine the status of a component with children
